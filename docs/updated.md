## Simple Auto HD has been updated to v2.0.5!

This chrome web store update includes both 2.0.4 and 2.0.5 updates at same time, rolled into one for convenience.

Latest version: v2.0.5 
### Updates:
1. Fixed mutation observer issue in previous version to also use timeout for at least 100ms to make sure element is ready for manipulation.
2. Added extension enable/disable feature from the popup menu.
3. Added two way binding for theater mode. Toggling theater mode from YouTube page will also save the changes to the extension.

Older version: v2.0.4 

### Updates:
1. Added support for all international languages supported by YouTube.

2. The quality toggle code has been changed to use mutation observer instead of Javascript timeouts.
It will be much more stable on instances of variable(faster/slower) internet speed.

3. Redesigned the Popup Menu to make it much more intuitive.

4. Updated the extension logo to have white text instead of transparent one for better visibility.
