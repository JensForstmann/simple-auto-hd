2. The quality toggle code has been changed to use Mutation Observer instead of Javascript Timeouts.
It will be much more stable on instances of variable(faster/slower) internet speed.

3. Redesigned the Popup Menu to make it much more intuitive.

4. Updated the extension logo to have white text instead of transparent one for better visibility.
